This project analyzes ball-by-ball IPL data to extract insights on team and player performance. Metrics such as run rates, strike rates, and wickets were examined to reveal batting and bowling trends. Using Python and visualization tools like Matplotlib, I presented key findings to help understand strategies and player efficiency.
